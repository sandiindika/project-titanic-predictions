### **Challenge**

The Titanic's sinking is one of history's most well-known ship tragedies.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, known as the "unsinkable ship," crashed and sank after striking with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were insufficient lifeboats to accommodate everyone on board, resulting in the deaths of 1502 of the 2224 passengers and crew.

Although luck plays a role in survival, it appears that certain groups of people are more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we will create a prediction model to answer the question, "What types of people are more likely to survive?" by employing passenger information (e.g., name, age, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.).
